# A template chart to deploy a R Shiny app on the SSP Cloud

This repository provides a [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/) aimed at easily deploying a R Shiny application on the [SSP Cloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/home). A [companion repository](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/template-shiny-app) contains the source code of the example R Shiny app which is being deployed by this Helm chart. 

A [tutorial](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/sspcloud-tutorials/blob/main/deployment/shiny-app.md) describes (in French) the complete deployment procedure.

The example R Shiny App is deployed [here](https://myshinyapp.lab.sspcloud.fr).
